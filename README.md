Welcome to our Taki bot!
Created by: Ron, Giora, Yoni and David
To run the bot, open IDLE or PyCharm and press F5 or Ctrl-Shift-F10 on the code called backed_ratings.
Don't forget to go into the code and change the IP/Port to the needed ones (localhost + 50000 as default)
To view the front end, go into the Taki.rar zipped folder, unzip it, and run its code by opening the .csproj file (not .sln!) and also changing the place of the 'info.json' file in the GameManager.cs file to its place.
Run the front-end only after running the python code.
Enjoy!
