Welcome to our Taki bot!
Created by: Ron, Giora, Yoni and David
To run the bot, open IDLE or PyCharm and press F5 or Ctrl-Shift-F10 on the code called backed_ratings.
Don't forget to go into the code and change the IP/Port to the needed ones (localhost + 50000 as default)
To view the front end, go into the c# file and run its code. Do so after running the python code
Enjoy!
